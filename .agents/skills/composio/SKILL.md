description: Use 1000+ external apps via Composio - either directly through the CLI or by building AI agents and apps with the SDK
tags: [composio, tool-router, agents, mcp, tools, api, automation, cli]
---

## When to Apply

- User wants to access or interact with external apps (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, etc.)
- User wants to automate a task using an external service (send email, create issue, post message)
- Building an AI agent or app that integrates with external tools
- Multi-user apps that need per-user connections to external services

## Setup

Check if the CLI is installed; if not, install it:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://composio.dev/install | bash
```

After installation, restart your terminal or source your shell config, then authenticate:
```bash
composio login       # OAuth; interactive org/project picker (use -y to skip)
composio whoami      # verify org_id, project_id, user_id
```
For agents without direct browser access: `composio login --no-wait | jq` to get URL/key, share URL with user, then `composio login --key <cli_key> --no-wait` once they complete login.

### 1. Use Apps via Composio CLI

**Use this when:** The user wants to take action on an external app directly — no code writing needed. The agent uses the CLI to search, connect, and execute tools on behalf of the user.

Key commands (new top-level aliases):
- `composio search 「<query>」` — find tools by use case
- `composio execute 「<TOOL_SLUG>」 -d '{...<input params>}'` — execute a tool
- `composio link [toolkit]` — connect a user account to an app (agents: always use `--no-wait` for non-interactive mode)
- `composio listen` — listen for real-time trigger events

Typical workflow: **search → link (if needed) → execute**

### 2. Building Apps and Agents with Composio

**Use this when:** Writing code — an AI agent, app, or backend service that integrates with external tools via the Composio SDK.

Run this first inside the project directory to set up the API key:
```bash
composio init
```
