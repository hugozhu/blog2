# composio

Use 1000+ external apps via Composio - either directly through the CLI or by building AI agents and apps with the SDK

## When to Apply
- User wants to access or interact with external apps (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, etc.)
- User wants to automate a task using an external service (send email, create issue, post message)
- Building an AI agent or app that integrates with external tools
- Multi-user apps that need per-user connections to external services

# Composio CLI Guide

Use the Composio CLI to search, connect, and execute tools directly — no code writing required. Ideal for agents taking actions on behalf of the user.

## Prerequisites (first-time setup)

If the CLI is not installed or the user is not authenticated:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://composio.dev/install | bash
composio --version   # verify

# Authenticate
composio login       # OAuth flow; interactive org/project picker after login (use -y to skip)
composio whoami      # verify org_id, project_id, user_id (API keys are never displayed)
# Run upgrade in case you run into errors or starting with a new project
composio upgrade
```

> **Note**: Use `whoami` only to verify login status — do not hardcode these values in code. `whoami` shows hints for `composio manage orgs switch` and `composio init` when relevant.

**Login behavior**: By default, `composio login` shows an interactive org/project picker after OAuth. Use `composio login -y` to skip the picker and use session defaults. JSON output is emitted only after the picker finishes (or immediately with `-y`), so piped/scripted usage gets the correct `org_id` and `project_id`.

**Agent login (no direct browser access)**: For agents that cannot open a browser for the user, use a two-step flow:

1. **Get login URL and session key** — Print login URL and JSON (jq-parseable) then exit without opening browser or waiting:
   ```bash
   composio login --no-wait | jq
   ```
 Share the login URL with the agent's user to complete login in their browser.

2. **Complete login with session key** — Use the `key` from the previous output to check if the user has logged in:
   ```bash
   composio login --key "<key>"
   ```
 Without `--no-wait`: polls until the session is linked (same as browser flow after printing URL).
 With `--no-wait`: checks once and fails if not linked. For agents, once the user completes login, run with `--no-wait` to avoid blocking.

## Primary Workflow: search → link → execute

### Step 1 — Find the right tool

```bash
composio search "send an email"
composio search "create github issue"
composio search "post slack message"
```

The search results include connection status, so you can see immediately if the user is already connected to the required app.

> **Important**: Do not trim the output of `composio search` (e.g. with `head`). Use the full results to pick the right tool — truncating can hide the best match.

### Step 2 — Connect an account (if needed)

If the user is not connected to the app, link their account:

```bash
composio link gmail
composio link github
composio link slack
```

This opens an OAuth flow or prompts for credentials. Only needed once per app. By default, `composio link` waits until the connected account is ACTIVE (opens browser, polls). Use `--no-wait` for scripted or agent usage: it prints link info and JSON to stdout (JQ-friendly) and exits immediately. Output includes `status`, `connected_account_id`, `redirect_url`, and `toolkit`.

### Step 3 — Execute the tool

```bash
composio execute GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL --data '{"recipient_email":"you@example.com","subject":"Hello","body":"Test"}'
composio execute GITHUB_CREATE_AN_ISSUE --data '{"owner":"acme","repo":"my-repo","title":"Bug report"}'
```
To see a tool's input parameters before executing:
```bash
composio execute GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL --help
```

### Step 4 — Listen for events (optional)

```bash
composio listen
```

Streams real-time trigger events to the terminal.

## Tips for Agents

- **All commands output JSON** — pipe to `jq` for filtering and extraction
- **Agent login** — When the agent has no direct browser access, use `composio login --no-wait` to get the URL and key, share the URL with the user, then `composio login --key <key> --no-wait` once they complete login
- **Parallel execution** — use `&` and `wait` or shell scripts for complex multi-step tasks
- The default user context is the project's `test_user_id`. Pass `--user-id <id>` to act on behalf of a specific user.

```bash
composio execute GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL --user-id "user_123" --data '{"recipient_email":"them@example.com","subject":"Hi"}'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `jq` for JSON** — Pipe CLI output to `jq` for filtering and extraction instead of parsing raw JSON.
2. **Control output at source** — When fetching large amounts of data, use the tool's filters (if supported) to limit what is returned.
3. **Offload analysis** — After understanding the schema, use inline bash scripts for heavy data analysis instead of manual inspection. Avoid using composio SDK for personal usecases only use the SDKs when building apps.
4. **Parallelize independent actions** — For tools/actions that don't depend on each other, run them in parallel with `&` and `wait`. Use `xargs -P` or `parallel` only when the backend can handle the load.
5. **Avoid large terminal dumps** — Filter, search, and summarize instead of outputting full datasets:
 - Quick text filtering: `grep -E`, `rg` (ripgrep), `awk`, `sed`
 - Summarize: `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr`, `wc -l`, `head`, `tail`
 - For large output: `less`, `lnav` (logs), `tail -f` for streaming
6. **Minimize file creation** — Use ephemeral files only when needed; create files only when the user explicitly asks.
7. **Respect rate limits** — Be mindful of pagination and API/CLI rate limits when parallelizing.
8. **Never invent tool slugs or app names** — Only use tools returned by `composio search`. For app names, use `composio manage toolkits info <slug>` or `composio manage tools info <tool>` to verify.
9. **Do not trim `composio search` output** — Never pipe search results through `head`, `tail`, or similar. Use the full output to find the best tool match.

## Advanced Commands

### Discover Tools (when search isn't enough)

```bash
# List all toolkits
composio manage toolkits list

# Get details about a specific toolkit
composio manage toolkits info "gmail"

# List tools in a toolkit
composio manage tools list --toolkits "gmail"

# Get a tool's full schema
composio manage tools info "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL"
```

### Connected Accounts

```bash
# List active connections
composio manage connected-accounts list --status ACTIVE

# Link an account (full form with options)
composio manage connected-accounts link --auth-config "ac_..." --user-id "user_123"

# Delete a connection
composio manage connected-accounts delete <id>
```

### Auth Configs

> Only needed when building apps with custom OAuth credentials. For personal use and agents, `composio link` handles this automatically.

```bash
composio manage auth-configs list --toolkits "gmail"
composio manage auth-configs create
composio manage auth-configs info <id>
composio manage auth-configs delete <id>
```

### Triggers

```bash
# List available trigger types
composio manage triggers list
composio manage triggers info "GMAIL_NEW_GMAIL_MESSAGE"

# Manage trigger instances
composio manage triggers create <trigger-name>
composio manage triggers enable <id>
composio manage triggers disable <id>
composio manage triggers status
```

### Debugging & Logs

```bash
# View recent tool executions
composio manage logs tools

# Get detailed logs for a specific execution
composio manage logs tools "log_abc123"

# Monitor trigger events
composio manage logs triggers
```
---

## jq Examples

```bash
# Extract toolkit slugs
composio manage toolkits list | jq -r '.[].slug'

# Get tool names from a toolkit
composio manage tools list --toolkits "gmail" | jq -r '.[].name'

# Filter active connections
composio manage connected-accounts list --status ACTIVE | jq -r '.[].id'

# Extract login URL and key from agent login flow
composio login --no-wait | jq -r '.login_url'
composio login --no-wait | jq -r '.key'
```

# Building Apps and Agents with Composio

Use the Composio SDK to build AI agents, chat apps, and backend services that integrate with 200+ external tools.

## Project Setup

Run inside your project directory to initialize and store the API key:
```bash
composio init
```

## Install the SDK

**TypeScript**
```bash
pnpm install @composio/core@latest
```

Provider packages for agentic frameworks:
- `@composio/vercel` — Vercel AI SDK
- `@composio/openai-agents` — OpenAI Agents
- `@composio/langchain` — LangChain
- `@composio/mastra` — Mastra
- `@composio/claude-agent-sdk` — Claude Agent SDK

**Python**
```bash
pip install composio
```

Provider packages for agentic frameworks:
- `composio-openai-agents` — OpenAI Agents
- `composio-langchain` — LangChain
- `composio-langgraph` — LangGraph
- `composio-crewai` — CrewAI
- `composio-claude-agent-sdk` — Claude Agent SDK
- `composio-google-adk` — Google ADK

Pass the provider into the Composio constructor:
```typescript
import { Composio } from '@composio/core'
import { VercelProvider } from '@composio/vercel'

const composio = new Composio({ provider: new VercelProvider() })
```
```python
from composio import Composio
from composio_langchain import LangchainProvider

composio = Composio(provider=LangchainProvider())
```

## Building Agents

Use Tool Router to create isolated MCP sessions per user with scoped tool access and automatic auth management. Compatible with any AI framework.

### Session Management
- [User ID Best Practices](tr-userid-best-practices.md) — choose user IDs for security and isolation
- [Creating Basic Sessions](tr-session-basic.md) — initialize Tool Router sessions
- [Session Lifecycle](tr-session-lifecycle.md) — when to create vs reuse sessions
- [Session Configuration](tr-session-config.md) — configure toolkits, tools, and filters
- [Using Native Tools](tr-mcp-vs-native.md) — prefer native tools for performance and control

### Authentication Flows
- [Auto Authentication in Chat](tr-auth-auto.md) — enable in-chat auth flows
- [Manual Authorization](tr-auth-manual.md) — use `session.authorize()` for explicit flows
- [Connection Management](tr-auth-connections.md) — configure `manageConnections`, `waitForConnections`, and callback URLs

### Toolkit Querying & UI Building
- [Building Chat UIs](tr-building-chat-ui.md) — toolkit selection, connection management, and session handling
- [Query Toolkit States](tr-toolkit-query.md) — use `session.toolkits()` to check connections and build connection UIs

### Framework Integrations

### Core Operations
- [Fetching Tools](app-fetch-tools.md) — get tools with filters and search
- [Direct Tool Execution](app-execute-tools.md) — execute tools manually with parameters
- [Tool Version Management](app-tool-versions.md) — version pinning strategies for stability

### Resource Management
- [Connected Accounts CRUD](app-connected-accounts.md) — create, read, update, delete connected accounts
- [Auth Config Management](app-auth-configs.md) — manage authentication configurations
- [Toolkit Management](app-toolkits.md) — query toolkits, categories, and auth requirements
- [Auth Popup UI](app-auth-popup-ui.md) — build popup-based OAuth flows

### Extensibility
- [Tool Modifiers](app-modifiers.md) — schema modification and execution hooks for logging and modifications

### User Context & Multi-Tenancy
- [User ID Patterns](app-user-context.md) — user vs organization IDs, shared vs isolated connections

### Event-Driven Applications
- [Creating Triggers](triggers-create.md) — set up trigger instances
- [Subscribing to Events](triggers-subscribe.md) — listen to events in real-time
- [Webhook Verification](triggers-webhook.md) — verify incoming webhooks
- [Managing Triggers](triggers-manage.md) — enable, disable, update triggers

## Verify Tool Slugs Before Use

Never guess toolkit, tool, or trigger names. Always verify:

```bash
composio search "send email"
composio manage tools info "GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL"
composio manage toolkits info "gmail"
```

Using incorrect slugs causes runtime errors.
